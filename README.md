# Marathon Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of marathon data using Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to study different datasets and visualize the data using various plotting tools.

## Notebooks

1. `RunningEvent.ipynb`

- Creates tables and manually adds made-up data. 
- Provides a basic structure for marathon-related data.

2. `RunningEventKaggleDataset.ipynb`

- Uses a dataset from Kaggle containing Boston Marathon data.
- Analyzes a larger set of data for better visualization and insights.

## Data Visualization

Both notebooks use Matplotlib and Seaborn to experiment with different plotting techniques for marathon-related metrics. The visualizations help to identify trends and patterns in the data.
